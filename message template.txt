I was researching {{role description}} roles on your team. Your search for someone who has worked on {{X}} and {{Y}} caught my attention.

Over the past 15 years, I have:
– Led and mentored teams of 10+ engineers and data scientists, both onshore and off.
– Managed {{statistic}} while implementing {{project description}}.
– Grown {{statistic}} by {{action}} resulting in growth from {{statistic}} to {{statistic}}. 

If you think it makes sense, would you be open to hopping on a call to share a bit more about this role and how you’ve liked working with {{COMPANY}}?
